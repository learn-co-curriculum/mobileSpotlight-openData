The first week we mentioned that 90% of the data that has ever been created has been created in the last two years.  **Open Data Initiatives** represent an effort by governments all over the world to make all of the data that they collect open and accessible, so that programmers like you can use it to make the world a better place to live, work, and play.  

**To do #1**: *What type of data sets do you think governments have that could be useful for the public?  What type of data sets do you think government has that could drive useful technology?*


**To do #2:** *Look through the applications built using [US Open Data](https://www.data.gov/applications), and select one with your table that you find interesting to share with the class. *
