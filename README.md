Open Data.

The first week we mentioned that 90% of the data that has ever been created has been created in the last two years.  **Open Data Initiatves** represent an effort by governments to make all of the data that they collect open and accessible, so that programmers like you can use it to make the world a better place to live, work, and play.  

Look through the applications built using this data, and select one with your table to share with the class.  [US Open Data](https://www.data.gov/applications)
